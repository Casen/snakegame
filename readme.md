# Snake Game w/ Deep Q Learning
![The snake is alive!](/snakeai.gif)
After recently getting hooked on an original pacman arcade, I became interested in learning to create some simple games of my own. True to my roots, I became simultaneously interested in brushing up on machine learning principles and continuing to flex my Golang muscles. Creating any machine-learning app in Golang as a beginner is an exercise in near futility, as the vast majority of books and examples to learn from are based on Python. Never the less, I persevered, and I'd like to make this code available to any would-be golang gaming and ai enthusiasts. 

## Resources I learned from for this project
[Alex Pliutau's primer on ebiten engine and snake](https://pliutau.com/ebiten-snake/)
[Mauro Comi's helpful post on a python version of snake and reinforcement learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-teach-an-ai-to-play-games-deep-reinforcement-learning-28f9b920440a)
[Hand's on Deep Learning with Go](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Deep-Learning-with-Go)

## Important warnings
Unfortunately, Hands-on Deep Learning with Go is riddled with bugs and outright errors when it comes to their example projects in the book. Chapter 7 about deep Q learning was wholly incomplete and quite a number of key dots in the algorithm were left unconnected. It was only through learning the mathematics behind deep Q learning and the bellman equation, and comparing notes with examples in python that I was able to bridge the gap and successfully complete this project.

This was a toy project I put together over the course of a couple weeks. I was learning many new concepts all at once, and I was not focused on Golang best practices. For that reason, this code could use a lot of improvement. If I have the time, I might get around it it... oh wait, I hear the baby crying, brb.
